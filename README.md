# The more you fuck around the more you find out

i just want to try out vite with react typescript and tailwind css because i have never used any of these and they seem fun

im probably just going to make a personal page or remake cant.hu

to build it just run: `npm run build`

if you want to fuck around with it just write: `npm run dev`
